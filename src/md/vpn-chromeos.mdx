##### Troubleshooting

- Fails to connect

	Check to make sure you have filled out all of the fields correctly.
	There may also be a WiFi policy that blocks VPN's. Try on a different
	network.

- It shows connected, but my IP doesn't change

	WiFi policy again. Don't worry, the built-in ad blocking and tracker
	blocking will still be doing its thing!
