*If this doesn't show up, then StrongSwan is enabled-by-default
on your Chromebook. You can skip this step.						<br />
**If this option doesn't show up, your Chromebook is an older
model that does not support StrongSwan.								<br /><br />

##### Troubleshooting

- Fails to connect												<br />

	Check to make sure you have filled out all of the fields correctly.
	There may also be a WiFi policy that blocks VPN's. Try on a different
	network.

- It shows connected, but my IP doesn't change					<br />

	There may be a WiFi policy set by your administrator that
	partially blocks VPNs. Don't worry, the ad and tracker-blocking
	will still work.												<br /><br />
