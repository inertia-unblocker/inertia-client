Unfortunately, Windows systems do not support IKEv2 + PSK VPN's at this
time. If you have a good knowledge of using the terminal and coding in
c++, you can try to build the official StrongSwan client for Windows
using MinGW. More information is available [here](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/os/windows.html#_installation). 
To my knowledge, StrongSwan does not provide a prebuilt installer for this software. Inertia may 
provide an **unofficial** prebuilt version in the future.
