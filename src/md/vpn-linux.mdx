##### Troubleshooting

* `Failed to start strongswan.service. Unit strongswan.service not found.`		<br />

	Try making sure you have the correct packages installed, or make sure you spelled the start command correctly. If this still
	doesn't work, try `sudo systemctl start strongswan-swanctl.service`. **This might not work**.
